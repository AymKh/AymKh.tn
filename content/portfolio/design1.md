ISLAIB vs Corona is a project that I undertook in the summer of 2019.
It is a free and open-source 3D video game. I built it on top of Unity3D engine with the use of ProBuilder.  
Most of the models are made in Blender or downloaded from free marketplaces such as opengamart.org.  

The game is live on [itch.io](https://aymkh.itch.io/islaibvscorona)
