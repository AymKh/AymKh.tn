# Junior DevOps Engineer  

I am a Full-stack web developer who's interested in DevOps.  
I Love contributing to open source projects and I do maintain few ones myself.  
I enjoy playing online CTFs [LHC, Picota..] so I went ahead and created my own [ctf.tn ↗️](https://lhc.dev/).  
I run a [YouTube Channel ↗️](https://juniorderv.tn/) where I teach the basics of programming and DevOps in my native dialect.
