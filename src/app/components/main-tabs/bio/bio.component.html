    <p>I am a Full-stack web developer whoâ€™s interested in DevOps.</p>
    <p>I Love contributing to open source projects and I do maintain few ones myself.</p>
    <p>I enjoy playing online CTFs [LHC, Picota..] so I went ahead and created my own <a href="https://ctfbaic.netlify.app/" mat-stroked-button>ctf.tn</a></p>
    <p>I run a <a href="https://juniordev.tn" mat-stroked-button>YouTube Channel</a> where I teach the basics of programming and DevOps in my native dialect.</p>
